# Don Juan (1926)

* Recorded score primarily by William Axt, performed by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra
* Vitaphone - recorded music and some sound effects. Not dialog, still a silent film
* Also had a second score composed for *live* performances.

# The Jazz Singer (1927)

The era of the **Talkies** begins.

But the Jazz Singer is mostly silent.

* Primarily silent
* Most of the score is compiled or adapted
* Made use of the Vitaphone System
* Why is it still a primarily a silent film?
* A finance hit
* Signaled the beginning of the end for silent film.

It is still primarily a silent film because the theatres often did not have a Vitaphone system with speakers. The technology was unconventional. It's like the start of 3D movies. They needed it to be silent compatible for the many theatres.

Story of a young man growing up in a strict Jewish family. Father is a cantor, a person who sings the verses of the Torah. Son is supposed to do the same thing, but he doesn't want to, he wants to be a popular musician, a Jazz Singer.

Dialogue was very awkward because Al Jolsen was improvising the dialogue. This is because there are no script writers yet.

There was a big gap at the end where the father was staring because they had to switch from the record with the talking to the one without.

Acting styles are about to dramatically change. Actors had learned to act to convey everything, but now that there is sound, the demonstrative approach to acting is too much.

## Early Problems

**Aesthetics**:

* Change in technology = change in aesthetics
* Film had developed visually as a silent medium
* Acting styles / voices

Many silent actors were out of business. They had awful voices or thick accents.

Had to have the musicians and sound effects on the set, since they couldn't add it later.

## Making Films

* Cameras in large booths, needed to shoot through a pane of glass otherwise the microphone would pick up the sound of the cameras.
* All of the sophisticated camera shots are gone, since it is locked in a sound proof box.
* Musicians on set - balance of sound music and dialog.
* Balancing sounds involved moving the band or moving the microphone to balance the sounds better

## Showing Films

* Too many contesting sound systems
* Small number of the 20000 theatres equipped for sound.
* End of 1930 almost 9000 theatres with sound, and it is sound on film, Vitaphone lost.
* By 1935, the transition is complete.
* Massive layoffs of theatre music.

Vitaphone is fighting sound on film. Noone wanted to pick the wrong format for their theatre, so transition was slow until a clear winner emerged.

Theaters employed 100000s of musicians, they were one of the main sources of employment for musicians. The transition to sound put many of them out of work.

## Development of the Studio Began

* During the 1920s studios began to expand.
* Bringing together all the elements needed to make films under one company. Why?
* By the early 1930s, Hollywood is divided into 8 studios:
1. The Big Five: MGM, Paramount, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, RKO
2. The Little Three: Universal, Colombia, United Artists

Majors control production, distribution and exhibition.

Minors dependent for last 2.

Talking films were expensive, many smaller studios couldn't survive. The tech required to record sound was complicated and expensive, the average company couldn't make a movie anymore.

They big five have their own film distribution networks and own theater chains.

## The Depression (1930s)

* Even tighter control over all aspects of film
* Numerous theaters closing
* All aspects of production are departmentalized - directors, actors, and musicians are put under contract - leads to the Studio System

To cut costs, the Big Five and the Little Three develop the **studio system**. Everything they need to make a film is at the studio, and everyone works for the studio. Actors, directors, film editing, script writers, composers, musicians, all full-time employed by one of the major studios.

You therefore know approximately how much everything will cost.

Under the studio system, you could be employed under contract so if you take off, you could be locked in for a certain price for years.

It kept costs predictable and low.

## Max Steiner (1888-1971)

First major studio composer.

* Born in Vienna, middle class, father owned a theater.
* Formally trained in the tradition of European classical music.
* Child prodigy, conducting in theater by age 12, touring as a conductor by 16.
* One of his teachers was Gustav Mahler.
* Wrote operettas, first by age 17.
* Also worked as a composer and conductor of music for stage in England.
* Facing deportation because of WW1 comes to US in 1914.

He worked on Broadway for 15 years. Invited to Hollywood in 1929 with **Rio Rita**.

When Hollywood realized they had problems with actor's voices, they turned to Broadway, where there were scripts and actors who could sing.

They started shooting films of plays in the late 1920s because the scripts already existed.

Two of the most successful films were **Rio Rita/Broadway Melody**.

By 1930, little music in dramatic films - *where does it come from?*

**The Blue Angel (1930)** all music originates from a diegetic source.

Max Steiner liked how quickly he could get music recorded, Hollywood streams getting his music out there real fast.

But Broadway Musicals become less popular, switch to scripts, and someone asks if non-diegetic music would be confusing.

For a while, there is no music in Hollywood films because they are scripted films, not broadway musicals, so why have music in a serious talkie?

## Cimmaron (1931)

Score by Max Steiner, David Selznick at RKO recognized that more music might be good.

He was so impressed, wanted to make movies with music again.

## Symphony of 6 Million and Bird of Paradise (1932)

These films have almost complete musical accompaniment. Reviews said that the music made a huge difference. Music was back.

## King Kong (1933)

* Worried that it would be a flop
* Steiner was asked to do a compiled score
* Convinces producer to create original score

The initial screenings without music had people laughing, not afraid. But Steiner wrote his own score, and people loved it.

It's only 1933, and Steiner writes a theme that is atonal, centered on three descending notes.

This is a creature that is unpredictable, dangerous, and he uses atonality for that. If you want to carry musically a sense of threat, use atonality. For power, use big brass instruments.

Music being associated with elements of the fantastic. You know the ghost has entered the room when the spooky music hits, etc.

Can hear uncertainty in the music. The harp is used for its connection to otherworldiness and the supernatural.

Max Steiner opened the door to the inclusion of non-diegetic music.

## The Informer (1935)

* Won Academy Award for Best Original Score
* It has only been 2 years from King Kong and recognizing the importance of music, the Academy has made awards for music.
* This is only the 2nd Academy Award given for an original score.
* Max Steiner is a reason the Academy Awards has an Original Score category.

The Informer is set in the time of the Irish Civil War.

The Irish were leaving and going to America. In order to raise the money to go, he rats out one of his friends to the British. He becomes a wanted man to both the British and the Resistance.

Most of his important work is during the 1930 to the early 1950s.

Workaholic, contributed to over 300 film scores during his career, died in 1971.

## 1930s

Sound film develops many of the conventions that will define it.

Begins as an extension of the silent film but by the end of the decade, technical advances and aesthetic changes have developed it into its own medium.

## The Emigre Composer

Nazis force out many of Europe's artists and intellectuals. Erich Korngold, Dimitri Tiomkin, Franz Waxman, Ernst Gold, Hans Salter, Bronislau Kaper, Miklos Rosza.

Most were composers trained in the traditions of European art music and these traditions were transplanted into Hollywood during the 1930s.

Alfred Newman and Herbert Stothart are two of the few important American born composers of the period.

## Erich Wolfgang Korngold (1897-1957)

Born in 1897 in Vienna. Childhood prodigy, son of noted music critic. Teachers included Strauss and Mahler.

Austria annexed by the Nazis and all of his family's wealth and property were seized because he was Jewish.
