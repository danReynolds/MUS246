# Scores and Soundtracks

The original **score** is mostly instrumental music that was composed for the film; the **soundtrack** is a collection of popular music that influences the film or is featured within it.

If all of the music is taken from a pre-existing score without any alteration then it is a **compiled score**.

In the early days of film, compiled scores were very common, however today they are rarely used.

## Style

What type of music has the composer chosen?

What type of instruments?

How do these choices relate to the film as a whole?

Ex.1 Restoration (1995) Composer: James Newton Howard

* Set in the mid 1600s.
* Score is part original, part adapted , based on the work of Henry Purcell, an important composer of the period.
* Use of period instruments including harpsichord

Ex.2 Local Hero (1983) Composer: Mark Knopfler

* Plots follows an urban American in a small Scottish village
* Blend of folk and popular styles
* Emphasis on instruments such as the guitar
* Knopfler developed melodies similar to Anglo Celtic folk music

Focus on instruments like the guitar, acoustic guitar, fiddle.

Ex.3 The Godfather (1972) Composer: Nino Rota

* Follows the life an an organized crime family
* Much of the instrumentation and melodies based on the folk music of Sicily

Brass can also be associated with sacrifice, which while often a military idea, can also be used in the GodFather because
of its themes of loyalty to the family and sacrifice for the sake of the family.

Main theme is trumpets that changes into a waltz. The waltz could be a metaphor of the dance of politics and the nuances of managing the transition, the struggle for power.

## Concept

* Is the music used in a consistent manner throughout the film?
* What is accompanied? What is left without accompaniment?
* What motivates the music? Action, characters, events, objects, flashbacks, etc?

Do we get music when we enter a flashback for example? What could that mean?

## Conceptual Approaches

Most film music will fall somewhere between two extremes:

1. Playing the Drama

* Music attempts to reinforce primarily emotional elements with the Narrative

2. Hitting the Action

* Music accents visual events
* Common approach to cartoon scoring
* Mickey Mousing

Music is motivated entirely but what is going on physically, not emotionally on the screen, like a car chase, dramatic suspense as it goes off a bridge, or music changes as they go upstairs, downstairs, fall, etc.

Often see it in comedies.

## Musical Characteristics

1. Melody or Theme

* Considered the most *recognizable* music element for western ears.
* Do characters, objects or situations have a particular melody associated with them?
* German Opera composer Richard Wagner - Leitmotive.
* Melodies can be taken through a number of variations to tell you what is going on within a particular character - thoughts or feelings, etc
* Are the melodies easy to hum, or are they angular and more difficult?

Wagner would change a character's main theme based on the story, for fighting, sorrow, joy, to reflect feelings, and situations. He called this **thematic transformation**.

Ex.1 Star Wars (1997) Composer: John Williams

Main theme sounds operatic, this is a Space Opera.

He wrote a theme for a character, Luke's Theme, and a concept: for the Force.

**Simon's Rule**: The hummability factor

The easier it is to hum a theme, the more likely it is involved with a character or concept you should be sympathetic with.

## Tempo or Pulse

How does the speed of the music influence the tempo of the narrative?

On screen action, framing, editing, sound design.

But some of the most interesting examples are when composers go against what you expect. The music is moving fast but the scene is slow or vice-versa.

Ex.1 The Return of the King (2004) Composer: Howard Shore

Faramir meeting the evil hordes, and Pippin sings his slow song as they all go to fast and violent ends. Pippin's song is *source/diagetic music*, music who's source is in the scene.

As the voice is singing, and we see the danger, instruments come in, and then they're all cacophonic, and loud.

Then at the most dangerous moment, the song ends and the arrows hit Faramir's knights.

Some things have sound, some don't. Hear Faramir draw his sword loudily, to signify his commitment and drive. But voice is soft, to indicate that there is no orders obeyed or that he lacks control. That his commands are in vain.

Get a sense of the helplessness.

## Harmony

* Difficult to describe without musical training
* Chaotic or orderly? Consonant or dissonant? What do these suggest about events in the Diegesis?

In the Return of the King, harmonizes the beautiful folk song of Pippin with the cacophonic underlying sounds to create a blend that is both folky and foreboding.

Highly Consonant: Main Theme from Cider House Rules (1999) Composer: Rachael Portman

Blend of Consonant and Dissonant: Yes from Meet Joe Black (1998) Composer: Thomas Newman

Dissonant: Bishop's Countdown from Aliens (1986) Composer: James Horner

**Tonal**: Do-Ray-Me scale
**Atonal**: Absence of tonality. No sense of the Do-Ray-Me scale.

## Technical Details: How It's Done

Basic Timetable of Film Production

1. Preproduction:

* Preparation phase
* Script writing and editing
* Financial backing
* Hiring of director, casting actors
* Location scouting
* Various aspects of production design (costume and set design, etc) undertaken
* Storyboarding, pre-visualization

**Executive Producer**: Writes Cheques. Make sure all permits have been arranged, and that the orcs swords, and other organizing.

**Director**: Focus on the aesthetics. Where to shoot the film, how to arrange the cameras, etc.

2. Production:

* Finalization of script and production design
* Principle photography

Shoot the film!

Generally principle photography is the most expensive stage of the film.

3. Postproduction:

* Assembling and editing the takes
* Completion and addition of visual and audio effects
* Compositions and addition of music

* Normally, an original film score is one of the final elements to be created and added to the film
* Historically, schedule for the composition and recording of a score: 5-8 weeks on average. Although often still the case, effects-driven films often have longer post-production periods.

## Composers

Composer's involvement varies based on working style and specifics of a given project:

**Hiring**:

* freelance or studio contract
* collaborative partnerships (Spielberg/Williams), (Nolan/Zimmer)

Film composers are generally freelancers now rather than parts of a studio like in the early days of filmmaking.

**Scripts**:

* Can give composers a headstart
* Research for ethnic or historical influences (Hans Zimmer, The Last Samurai)
* Production of important source music is done at this point
* In general, composing the score cannot be done on the basis of a script - why? Because a script leaves out the most important information. Scripts can be re-written. Only words, no clear timing or pace for the composer to work with.

**Screenings**:

* Several different opportunities to see the film
* Rushes: film shot that day
* Assembly cut: significantly longer than finished film, first attempt at editing the film. Director puts everything they might want to have in the film
* Rough cut: closer to finished film, but still undergoing significant editing
* Fine or locked cut: most if not all editing completed
* Most composers begin with serious work at the fine cut phase: Why?

Generally the composer wants to write for fine or locked cut footage. They know how long the scenes are from start to finish, don't have to worry about reworks.

John Williams wants to watch the film the way you will before having to write the music, so that he becomes inspired and responds to it once, the way the audience will.

**Temp Tracks**:

* Temporary music added to film while still in production or early editing.
* Gives more finished feeling to work in progress
* Often taken from other film scores or classical music

The problem with temp tracks is that the director will watch a film many times with the temp track and they can be influenced by the temp track or attached to it.

Composers are deeply divided on their view of temp tracks:

* Offer insight into director's thinking process
* **But** can influence the composer's initial response
* Director's familiarity with temp track can be an obstacle

## Spotting Session and Cue Sheets

* Director, composer, music editor, music supervisor go through the film
* Discussion on placement of cues
* Timings, approach, etc.
* Music editor then prepares **spotting notes**, or cue sheet.

## Composing

* 5-8 weeks until delivery of finished score
* Short timeline due to fixed release date
* Frequently exacerbated by production phase running overtime.

Ex.1 Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) Composer

Michael Kamen, 2 hours 11 min of music in 3.5 weeks.


## Orchestrators

Skilled in composition, music theory, and knowledge of the orchestra.

Very good at deciphering scribbles, know how different musical bodies want things orchestrated.

Orchestrators take the composer's rough work and fill in all the detail. They are decoding the work of the composer.

Get faxes from a composer that was a piece of sheet music with one note and 1 minute and 18 seconds wrote on top.

Composers work on white sheet music, orchestrators on yellow or green.

## Copyist

* Copyists produce final parts for musicians
* Music librarians organize parts for recording sessions, catalog sheet music, make sure it is infront of musicians when they perform, determine where people will sit
* Conductors and studio musicians (good sight readers)
* Recording sessions
* synchronization: punch and streamers / click tracks / SMPTE
* Mixing
