# The Silent Era

# Scene from Wall-E

A yard of film is about 2 seconds. They would take a whole punch in one frame when they got to the streamer, and the burst of white light with the whole punch is the punch.

This is how the conductor kept in timing. They would go by the white light flash.

It used to be done physically, but now it is done in software with a vertical line going left to right and a burst of light in the screen.

Thomas Newman worked on Nemo.

## The Persistence of Vision

If you can send a number of still images fast enough, it looks like motion, at 12-13 images per second.

The **Zoopraxiscope** projects several images to present the illusion of movement.

Thomas Edison figures out the Kinetoscope (1891) a peephole viewer with a continuous loop of film.

The Kinetophone (1895) was a kinetoscope with a phonograph installed.

Edison found that it was difficult for 2 electric motors to run at the same speed. This created problems with synchronization between the image and sound. It had problems with synchronization.

## First Projected Films

The Lumiere Brothers, Paris December 28th, 1895

- *The Arrival of a Train*

At all of these performances, there was musical accompaniment, a small orchestra or piano playing for example.

## Reasons for Musical Accompaniment

### Pragmatic Argument

1. Projectors are noisy machines, needed to hide the noise behind music.
2. Film would jam, bulb would burn out, and when shows frequently stopped, the piano player and musicians could continue to entertain the audience.

### Psychoanalytic Argument

This technology was revolutionary for the time, they were seeing pale, black and white images of people who appear to be alive but don't make sound. They look like ghosts, the undead. There was discomfort in seeing these initial images for the lack of color and sound. The music helped put some of the life back into the image.

The music was giving voice to the characters on the screen.

### Continuity of Tradition

Long history of musical accompaniment for visual presentation.

But at the time, this didn't make sense, noone watched music when they looked at pictures, and movies were initially seen as an extension of photography.

### Venues

* Vaudeville Theatres
* Musical accompaniment provided by vaudeville orchestra
* 1905 Nickelodeons
* 1907 had 3000 theaters, 1310, over 10000 theatres.

Accompaniment provided by gramophone, solo piano, piano with singer, small orchestra (less than 10 musicians)

* Popular to Classical - often little relationship to the film
* Improvisation to the film
* Illustrated Songs (Music Videos)
* Without music, but with sound effects, live dialog or narration
* Continuous music provided mechanically (Phonograph or Player Piano) - Ballyhoo music, rude or obnoxious

### The Shift to Narrative:

* George Melies:

* Early experiment with camera effects
* *A Trip to the Moon* (1902)

Starts making very long, over 10 minutes in length sometimes, first extravagant sets, costumes, special effects.

He actually did coloured movies in 1902. He had the films hand painted, since colored film did not exist. Hand painting each frame of a 10 minute film is crazy. Making a copy of it was also impractical.

* Edwin Porter:

*The Great Train Robbery* (1903)

First film to use cross-cutting.

### 1905-1910:

Narrative films become most important element - films become longer - plots become more complex.

Change in musical aesthetic from entertaining the audience to playing the picture. Supporting the drama and helping the audience follow the plot. Fitting, or synchronizing.

Song title accompaniment.

Classical music and limited improvisation.

### 1910-1920s

* Film industry matures
* Films become longer, more sophisticated
* First of the *Movie Palaces* built, 1912

See the rise of some of the big film companies like MGM, Paramount.

Big orchestras in the pit, 70-80 people.

Hollywood becomes the center of the western film industry. This is because of the work of Thomas Edison. Edison was a control freak, he cared mostly about money. He did not allow the names of actors to appear in the credits, so that actors could not become famous. There were no stars prior to 1910. The only place that would not enforce Thomas Edison's patents was Hollywood.

There is a remarkable variety of geography in California, so both the location and legality was on the side of setting the state for the Hollywood Era.

Star-system takes shape, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin.

Secondary industries appear: fan and industry magazines, music schools.

### Accompaniment

Some early attempts at creating original scores, but standard practice is either compilation of classical or popular music, or improvisation.

1909 - First attempt at standardizing musical accompaniment: Edison Film Company released musical suggestions with each film.

These were the first **Cue Sheets** with general scene-by-scene suggestions for musical accompaniment.

1912 Max Winkler (Carl Fischer Music) suggests specific pieces of music, with timing.

Films would be shipped with cue sheets, might also include music.

Problems with parts getting lost, etc.

Another option was to use **resource books**, *Sam Fox Moving Picture Music (Vol 1, 1913) J.S. Zamenik*.

The book was divided up by mood.

By 1915, complex theater organ with built-in sound effects begin to appear in large and mid-sized theaters.

1921, theater organist's school opens in Chicago.

By 1922, 500 theatres with orchestras.

Accepted Practice:

* Articles and columns on musical accompaniment
* Music should be continuous, not stop abruptly
* Source Music
* Song-title reference is bad taste
* Use of themes, really good theater musicians would pick a piece of music and link it to a character or location
* Good music, classical music, to the masses. Do not use pop music. Classical music is somehow better for you than pop music.

By mid 1920s, no real change:

* Vast range of performing forces and skills
* Rural or urban
* Missing cue sheets and scores
* Issues of control

Conductors at theaters saw themselves as more knowledgeable than the people at the movie studios, leading to issues of control. They might play the music differently than from at another theater.

### Birth of a Nation (1915)

Composer: D.W. Griffith - Hollywood's first *great* director
Carli Elinor - a music fitter
Breil, American born, European trained musician and composer

Assembles a continuous score 2/3s similar to Elinor, but 1/3 original material written for the film.

Debut in March of 1915.

The score you heard was dependent on where you were, varied.

### 1920s

Solution to the problems of musical accompaniment: **Recorded and Synchronized Sound**

Transition to sound,

* Sound and silent films existed together for several years
* Talkies were seen as a fad
* Driven by progress in recording technology

Not everyone wants this, by the 1920s, the film industry is accustomed to silent movies.

Charlie Chaplin hated talkies, kept with silent films into the 1930s.

The transition is not immediate, takes several years.

By the late 1920s, radio and recording are competing with sheet music. Sheet music has dominated for several decades, but recordings are now reaching a level of quality that they compete with live music, and radio has sufficient quality that live music is under attack.

Several competing systems emerged:

1. Phonofilm (1923): Sound on film system, photograph of sound waves on the edge of the film, excellent synchronization but poor audio quality.
2. Warner Brothers Vitaphone (1926): audio recording on a phonograph disk, synchronized with the film projector, excellent audio quality, poor synchronization. Could only play a vitaphone record a number of times before it was useless.

1926, Don Juan using Vitaphone was released.

Recorded score primarily by William Axt, performed by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.

Vitaphone, recorded music and some sound effects, still no dialog, so a silent film. Heard wind, background sounds, etc, but could not get dialog or time sensitive sound effects for synchronization issues.

Also had a second score composed for live performance, since many theaters do not have a vitaphone.

1927, the **Jazz Singer** was released. It was the first talking motion picture. Musical supervisor was Louis Silvers.
