* Unique set of instruments: violin, cello and bass, all three electric, two theremins, three electric organs, three vibraphones, two glockenspiels, two harps, three trumpets, three trombones, and four tubas.

* Cues tend to set a single mood and show little response to what happens minute by minute
* Overall the mood is bleak and has little emotional warmth

### Scene 1: The Money

* Short, repetitive theme that fractures
* Quiet but unsettled - Marion's discomfort with the theft
* Grows slightly in intensity as she decides to take the money

### Scene 2: The Flight

* Music enters as she makes her escape
* At first seems to play her fear at being caught
* But as she changes, music seems to play her fall to the dark side

### Scene 3: Norman

* Two semitones played in a variety of ranges (extremes of range - Norman)
* White tone, as Norman spies on Marion, no emotion, it's a high tone.

Herrmann shows that you don't need a big band, an orchestra or a performance ensemble. If you want, you can create not only unique music, but also a unique orchestration and sonic texture for your specific needs.
