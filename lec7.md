Subject matter:

* March 1930: The Production Code (Hays Office)
* Voluntary until 1934
* Films of the 1940s push the code, films of the 1950s begin to break it all together.
* Television content is more restricted due to influence of advertisers
* Foreign films (end of the Studio System means studios can no longer block films from other countries, not bound by the code)

Forced to do B-movies, like **Cat-Woman on the Moon (1953)**. They were designed to make the night at drive-ins a little longer by doing more movies.

## The Man with the Golden Arm (1955)

* Ensemble is a Jazz Big Band
* The score strongly Jazz influenced
* Jazz - urban - drug abuse
* Example of an attempt to cut a popular style as film score - effective for the most part, but awkward at times
* Phrasing the drama - then hitting the action.

* Agnes de Mille / Cecil B de Mille

## The Ten Commandments (1956)

## Dimitri Tiomkin (1894 - 1979)

* Born in Russia
* Played piano in Russian silent movie theaters

## Bernard Herrmann: (1911-1975)

* Born in New York City
* Studied at Juillard
* CBS radio in 1934
* Bumped into Orson Wells

People panicked from the Orson Wells radio play that people believed was real.

## Citizen Kane (1941)

## The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)

* Unique set of instruments: violin, cello and bass, all three electric, two theremins, three electric organs, three vibraphones, two glockenspiels, two harps, three trumpets, three trombones, and four tubas.
* Herman's approach: the sound of a score depends on the instrumentation
* Only required for recording session - no need to focus on performance ensemble

Super atonal, to the point that the music blends with the sound effects.

In 1955 begins collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock.

## Psycho (1960)

* Limited budget, was hard to get money for, partially because main character dies early. Shot in black and white.
* Herrmann uses only strings, *black and white* score.
* Uses the variety of sounds that can be produced by a string section
* Cues tend to set a single mood and show little response to what happens minute by minute
* Overall the mood is bleak and has little emotional warmth

### Scene 1: The Money

* Short, repetitive theme that fractures
* Quiet but unsettled - Marion's discomfort with the theft
* Grows slightly in intensity as she decides to take the money

### Scene 2: The Flight

* Music enters as she makes her escape
* At first seems to play her fear at being caught
* But as she changes, music seems to play her fall to the dark side

### Scene 3: Norman

* Two semitones played in a variety of ranges (extremes of range - Norman)
* White tone, as Norman spies on Marion, no emotion, it's a high tone.

Herrmann shows that you don't need a big band, an orchestra or a performance ensemble. If you want, you can create not only unique music, but also a unique orchestration and sonic texture for your specific needs.

### Scene 4: Arbogast's Mother

* Mother's theme as Arbogast climbs to the host
* Sound cloud as he enters
* gentle overtones as he climbs the stairs
* murder theme as he reaches the top of the stairs

### Scene 5: The Shower

* No music until the attack
* no tonality - strings shriek
* who's theme as the murderer flees the scene?

* Part company during the filming of Torn Curtain
* Bitter, he moves to Europe. Director Truffaut and Hermann did: Fahrenheit 451 (1966)
* Last movie is Taxi Driver (1975)

Hermann is a composer of the 20th century.

## Elmer Bernstein (1922-2004)

### The Magnificient 7 (1960)

* Influence of Aaron Copland
* clear melodies, folk song influence
* strong rhythmns, syncopation
* the sound of the American west / American nationalism

Key word: Versatility

* New generation of composers capable of working in a number of styles
* End of the Studio System leads to freelancing, composers can work for whoever they want

1960s: Turbulent period in American history:

* Civil rights
* Vietnam
* Generational gap

Early 50s are an extension of 50s, production code abandoned by mid 60s.

Films become more explicit, cynical irony, critique of current society.

Rise of independent production, cost escalates, sometimes smaller ensembles.

Rise of American composers: Bernstein, Goldsmith, Mancini.

Second wave of Europe, French: Maurice Jarr, English: John Barry, John Addison, Italian: Ennio Morricone

## The Good the Bad and the Ugly

Sound effects, electric guitars.

## The Mission

Catholic texts and musical styles.

## John Barry

Classical pianist and trumpeter.

## Dr.No

Monty Norman claimed he composed music for film, led to lawsuit since John Barry did all the work, but Normal wrote one tiny melody for Bond so he actually won the suit.

Barry has 5 Academy Awards: Born Free, Out of Africa, Dances with Wolves

## Modernism

Rejection of past in favor of new.

## 2001: A Space Odyssey

Score compiled from classical music, seen as new approach to relationship between music and film. Combination of tonal and atonal.

Directed by Kubrick, who was forced to use Alex North to score it, but he wanted a compiled score, often with music he didn't have the royalties or permission to use. He abandoned North's version and used the famous compiled score we recognize today.

## Jerry Goldsmith

Born in LA, west coast studied with Rosza at USC, came out of television. Cool because you could now go to school for film music, rather than switching to it from some *actual* profession.

His motto was that *less is more* when it comes to using music in films. Use it appropriately and don't overdo it.

## Patton (1970)

Sparse score, less than 40 minutes for a 3 hour film.

Music focuses on character of Patton, use of electronic processing on orchestral instruments.

Created echo effect for trumpet, to highlight the fact that Patton felt like he had been reincarnated as a warrior many times.

Scene: Advance in Europe

* Montage: blending of all three themes
* March theme accompanies Patton and advancing troops
* Religious theme accompanies the commanding officers
* Reincarnation theme when we see the list of German casualties

## Alien (1979)

* Use of electronic processing
* Contrast of tonal (human) and atonal (alien) elements
* Integration of music with sound effects
* Spent two days making the main theme for Aliens, but Ridley Scott didn't like it and Goldsmith wrote a simple, quick horror one instead that Scott liked

He uses flutes for humans. Plays at bottom of register, to sound delicate, in danger of being squashed.

He has violins for the aliens, playing quickly like if bugs running through walls. Gets the string players to turn violin bows around to strike strings with wooden part of bow, run through echo to get hollow, wooden kind of sound.

Scene 1:

* Flute in low range, quiet/fragile, represents the humans in hostile environment
* Contrast with electronic and atonal effects representing the alien environment

Scene 2:

* Pulse in harp adds to sound effects in creating tension
* Atonal melody builds anticipation with ticking/beeping sound effects
* Sound effects drop out - only music stabbing unexpectedly
* Sound effects and music build to complex

## Planet of the Apes (1968)

* Social and political critique of race. Lighter skin apes are in charge.
* Blend of orchestral instruments with elements such as animal horns and mixing bowls.
* Use of avant-garde/expressionist elements: 12-Tone
* Almost purely atonal, modernist music
* Goes tonal for the instant he does *Take your damn..** since for that moment, he has upper hand, goes tonal

Echoes, ram horns, etc.

Main theme unfolds itself in 4 sets of three notes.

Major scales have a structure everyone in the west can hear.

Arnold Schoenberg pioneers a new way of structuring music. They are referred to as the second Viennese school.

Their technique is called 12-Tone music. Developed as a technique to give structure to atonal music. The *scale* is referred to as a tone row. Need to use all 12 notes of the chromatic scale and cannot repeat a note until you have used all of them.

Best example of a film that is entirely based on 12-Tone technique.

No musical relief at the end, fade to black and sound of waves. Music doesn't come back in to say *oh it's okay, it's all just a film*, ends with a very defeatist feeling. Goldsmith knows when to write music and when to leave it out in order to create the biggest impact.

By the late 60s, early 70s, operatic influenced scores are almost unheard of. Just a few years after Planet of the Apes, a young man named George Lucas bumps into John Williams, bringing back the 1930s and bring back the orchestral score.
