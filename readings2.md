# Chapter 4

Film sounds can be divided into 3 categories:

1. Dialogue
2. Sound effects
3. Music

## Five Topics of Film Music:

### Placement

The appearance or disappearance of music at a precise moment. It can make an audience laugh, cry, feel suspense, etc.

In order to support and not distract from dramatic intention of the director, a composer must have a good sense of drama and humor.

**Music at the Opening and Closing Frames**:

* Alerts the audience, often with brass fanfares, to the beginning of the Film
* Introducing the dominant theme of the film as a whole
* Presenting several musical themes that will be heard in the film, when the music contains a series of tunes from the film, like in musicals, it is called a **medley**
* Establishing the mood of the film as a whole or of the opening scene
* Foreshadowing significant aspects of the story

Music at the closing can create a cheerful ambiance for the exiting audience. The closing credits reprise a number of important musical ideas from the film, but could also introduce a new song that could lead to a possible Oscar nomination for Best song.

**Overture**: precedes the beginning of the film
**Intermission**: Separates the two parts of the film
**Entr'acte**: Immediately precedes the resumption of the film, like an overture to the second part after the film

Order:

* Overture
* Main title and opening credits
* first part of the film
* Intermission (with or without music)
* entr'acte
* second part of the film
* closing credits

**Source music/diagetic music**: Music in the film universe, like a band playing in the movie.
**Underscoring/non-diegetic music**: Performed by an unseen, real-world orchestra, etc.

**Cue**: A passage of underscoring from its entrance to its end.

**Borrowings**:

Film music is either original or borrowed. Two terms are commonly used when discussing borrowed music: arrangement and adaptation.

An **arrangement** borrows melody from another source.

An **adaptation** borrows a complete passage from another source, including both melody and accompaniment.

In the silent film era, scores that are a bunch of borrowed music were called **compilation scores**, while in the sound era, we call them **adapted scores**.

**Musical Style**:

**Postromantic**:

Prevalent music style created by Wagner. The style encompasses the basic elements of Romanticism, such as the emphasis on melody and a wide range of emotions.

Colorful orchestrations, strong dissonances, ideally suited for the needs of film. Flexible, powerful and unobtrusive.

The generation of composers after Wagner exerted a great influence on film composers including Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, Sergei Rachmaninov.

* *Melody*: Great variety of melodies
* *Texture*: Melody-dominated
* *Harmony*: Traditional
* *Rhythm*: strong pulse, regular meter
* *Timbre*: Full orchestra common

**Modern**:

Music predominantly by concert composers writing for performances in opera halls and concert halls. Consciously written in a new experimental style, as opposed to postromantic or popular styles.

* *Melody*: avoids tunes, often disjunct
* *Texture*: variety of textures
* *Harmony*: dissonant
* *Rhythm*: irregular pulses and meter
* *Timbre*: often small, colorful ensembles

**Popular**:

* *Melody*: central role for tunes
* *Texture*: melody-dominated
* *Harmony*: traditional
* *Rhythm*: strong beat, syncopation
* *Timbre*: popular music ensembles

**Historical**:

* *Melody*: appropriate to era
* *Texture*: appropriate to era
* *Harmony*: appropriate to era
* *Rhythm*: appropriate to era
* *Timbre*: historical instruments

**Ethnic**:

* *Melody*: Appropriate to region
* *Texture*: Monophonic
* *Harmony*: No harmony
* *Rhythm*: Often complicated
* *Timbre*: indigenous instruments

A score that is characterized by the juxtaposition or combination of a wide variety of divergent musical styles is called an **eclectic score**.

## Function of Film Music

### Establishing a Mood

There are times when the music depicts a mood that deliberately does not match what is happening on screen. This is called **running counter to the action**.

Sacred organ music as Michael kills his enemies in the Godfather.

### Supporting the Plot

The music often reflects the emotions of a given scene or moment.

Contrasting movements of cross-cutting can be joined with consistent music. The rapid number of cuts in a montage often necessitates the use of music to create a sense of unity.

A sudden impact like a slap in the face can be accompanied by an accent in the orchestra and is called a **stinger**.

When the music too obviously mimics the physical actions in the movie, like every step of someone walking, it is called **Mickey Mousing**.

### Leitmotif

Music themes can represent the overall mood or underlying idea of a film without any specific connection to the drama.

A **leitmotifs** is a theme that can be identified with a person, object, or idea in a story. Such as the fanfare for Luke Skywalker or Obi-Wan Kenobi.

### Thematic Transformation

Helps to create variety and gives support to dramatic situations. Thematically alter a Leitmotif like Luke Skywalker's theme through the movie to reflect to sad, action, triumphant, dangerous scenes.

In Return of the Jedi, the death of Darth Vader is accompanied by his theme, but instead of his leitmotif being heart in the low brass with its terrifying authority, it is now played gently, suggesting the transformation of his character just before his death.

## Gone With the Wind Scene

* Steiner writes for a full symphony orchestra in a postromantic style.
* Music reflects a variety of emotional states
* Use of leitmotifs and thematic transformations
* Arrangements of well-known tunes: *Dixie* and *Taps*

# Chapter 5: Birth of an Art Form, 1895-1907

First coordination of music and moving pictures was with Thomas Edison.

Created the Kinetophone in 1895.

## Murder and Monopoly

The two leading names in the early history of American film are Eadweard Muybridge, an eccentric artist born in England. Recognize as one of the great photographers of the old West.

Thomas Edison was a gangster controlling the film industry, who knew.

## Narrative Film

The first moving pictures did not tell stories. It was originally an extension of photography.

Two figures most closely associated with the beginnings of narrative films are Georges Melies and Edwin Porter.

## Music

### Musical Accompaniment

The earliest films were in theaters to the accompaniment of orchestras, while subsequent films were a nickelodeons, small shows designed for showing films, usually costing a nickel.

### Placement of Music

Many theaters provided musical entertainments before and after a film, and the musicians rested during the showing of the film.

# Chapter 6: The Foundations of Modern Film (1908-1919)

First Major American Director: D.W. Griffith

## Developments in Film Music

By 1920 there were several trends:

* The organ became the most common movie theater instrument
* The size of musical ensembles in move theaters tended to expand
* Compilation scores incorporating excerpts from 19th century classics became common
* Cue sheets and music anthologies provided help for theater musicians
* Original scores were created for specific films

## Compilation Scores

Music for silent films can be divided into three types:

1. Adaptations of works from the classical repertoire
2. Arrangements of well-known patriotic, religious or popular tunes
3. Newly composed material

## Cue Sheets and Anthologies

Anthologies of bits of music like the *Motion Picture Piano Music: Descriptive Music to Fit the Action, Character, or Scene of Moving Pictures* was written to help movie makers determine what music to use in different scenes.

## Original Music Scores

Kalem company was a leading force in the creation of scores in the early 1910s, many composed by Walter Cleveland Simon.

**Camille Saint-Saens**, a composer know for his symphonies, concertos, operas and other popualr works. Wrote for the Film d'Art in Paris on the production *L'Assasinat du Duc de Guise*.

**Joseph Carl Breil**, created music for American showings for Queen Elizabeth by the Famous Plays Company in 1912.

In 1915 he scored *The Birth of a Nation* and created the music for *Intolerance*.

**Victor Herbert**, prominent figure in American music in the early 20th century, Irish American cellist, conductor and composer. Composed a symphonic score for *The Fall of a Nation* and the score is cited as the first fully original American film score.
