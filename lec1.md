Week 1: What to Listen for in Film

# Apollo 13

## Without Music

The musical accompaniment of Narrative Film. Ex. Apollo 13 (1995) Composer: James Horner

Launch day, before they're going to take off. Wife loses wedding ring in shower. Then cuts to scene in the Ready room.

In the ready room they understand the gravity of the situation, methodical, done it hundreds of times, very calm. But in the shower there is panic, frantic.

Put music in the **right** place, one of the biggest decisions filmmakers make is where to put music and where to not put it.

## With Music

## Shower scene

Ominous during shower scene, foreboding.

Powerful, respectful during ready room scene. Prepared.

No music. Why?

* Small, intimate scene. Music would lessen the impact. Risks over-dramatizing, it has to be intimate to the viewer, seem real, not grandiose like music would make it.
* Leaves space for what follows. After this scene, music continues for several minutes during the launch scene.
* Music would have dramatized it, make it a bigger moment than what follows. Scene is supposed to be a small life moment where a real woman is questioning the safety of her husband and her emotional relationship.

Where music isn't is as important as where it is.

## Ready room scene

Music fades in under show scene, smoothes the transition. Tells you that the scene is about to change.

**Instruments**: Brass

creates an air of military (Military Brass), heroism and sacrifice.

This is a convention.

**Style**: Chorale (Hymn, Sacred Song)

A sacred song, common in protestant hymn, gives air of sacrifice and faith. Appropriate for what the astronauts are doing.

They stood up to get the suits on and laid out their arms, but that's also the sign of the cross, another sacrifice.

**Tempo**: Slow

Restrained, controlled, professional. There is tension in the scene, everyone is professional and prepared.

## What is a movie?

Narrative: tells a story. *Suspension of disbelief*

Film conventions attempt to minimize anything that threatens suspension of disbelief except for the use of music.

Film is a **discontinuous medium**. You do not see events unfolding in real time, they are compressed, cut and fast-forwarded into a couple hours.

Don't show them the mechanisms, camera work, shots cut and compressed, and we will be immersed and suspend belief. It is the music that calls attention to the fact it isn't real.

## Four Functions of Music in Film

1. **Atmosphere**: Music can create a more convincing atmosphere of time and place. Either historical, cultural, geographical, based on western conventions, Hollywood doesnt care about accuracy, cares about getting the message across. Let the audience know as quickly as possible when and where you are.

2. **Psychological**: Music can underline or create psychological refinements. The unspoken thoughts of a character or the unseen implications of a situation.

A theme could be associated with a character off screen to associate the scene with him, or the music can be creepy to indicate a new character is dangerous, etc.

3. **Continuity**: Music can provide a sense of continuity in a film. Structure of music soothes over the discontinuous, chaotic nature of film. Continue music across scenes to string them together whereas without it it could seem abrupt and cut.

Think of a montage, a bunch of scenes, disconnected, like a training montage, that are joined in theme and story by the constant music.

4. **Pacing**: Music can provide the underpinning for the theatrical buildup of a scene and then round it off with a sense of finality. Music can affect the pacing, slowing down the scene, making it tense, and then coming to a resolution to indicate and assist the scene in conveying the activity is finished.

# Raiders of the Lost Ark

Composer: John Williams
Functions 1, 3, 4

Go from blizzard to desert

## Start Flight, Heroic

**Instruments**: Brass

For heroism, but only one trumpet, because he is not a military big organization, he is one guy. He is working alone.

## Love between Indy and partner developing over flight

**Instruments**: Strings

Love theme, romantic.

## Arrive in Egypt

**Instruments**: Oboe

Sounds the closest to some of the woodwind instruments you might find in Middle-Eastern culture. It isn't the same, not from that cultural, but it is cultural shorthand for the Middle East, even though they don't use Oboes.

It is about what white, western listeners will think is Egyptian and how to convey that quickly.

# Alien Resurrection

Composer: John Frizzell
Functions 2, 3, 4

## Ripley Basketball vs Annoying Guys

Pacing, underlying psychological refinements between fights and calm. No music at start to make it creepy, real feeling, not dramatized.

The chords lead up to the moment where she throws the basketball. Stops music so that when the basketball goes in, the focus is on it, emphasizes it.

## Evaluating a Score

How do we talk about music? Lots of terms.

**Diogesis**: The world of the narrative. All characters, events depicted, suggested or described in the film.

**Diegetic Music (Source Music)**: Any music heard by both the characters in the film and by the audience.

- Music whose source is within the Diegesis
- Heard both by the characters within the narrative and the film audience
- Also know as source music, having a source within the film
- Functions include: establishing time and place, creating a sense of realism and immediacy, offering ironic comment.

Could be a mother singing to a child, band playing at a bar, etc.

**Nondiegetic Music**: Heard by the film audience only. Referred to as the score.

- Normally originally composed for the specific film, original score
- May also include preexisting music adapted for the film.

Example: The Sting (1973), adapted the Entertainer song in the film.

An adapted score, done well, won't notice it has actually been changed. Like when they change the length of a piece, draw it out, to match the pacing.

If the entire score is made up of pre-existing pieces of music, it is a **compiled score**.
