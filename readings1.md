Max Steiner: Father of American film music

King Kong, Gone with the Wind, Casablanca

He says that Richard Wagner should be considered the father of movie music.

Richard Wagner: 19th century German opera composer, died in 1883.

## Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk

Had the revolutionary concept of total artwork, called Gesamtkunstwerk. Wagner argued that the individual artsits could not achieve their highest level of perfection by themselves.

He brought together brilliant philosophy and literature, stunning visual elements, scenery, costumes and lighting, acting and music.

Works include the masterpieces *Tristan und Isolde* and *Der Ring des Nibelungen*.


He wrote his own music for the operas, directed the staging and acting, dictated visual elements.

He even built his own theater so that he could best control his productions.

His Innovations:

* Darkening the auditorium during the performance
* Widening the distance between the audience and the stage with a double proscenium (the part of a theater stage in front of a curtain)
* He created an orchestra pit that extended beneath the stage so that the audience members do not see the musicians
* Members of the orchestra were not allowed to tune their instruments in the pit
* He insisted upon acting rehearsals before singing rehearsals began
* Unique and detailed scenery and visual effect were created for each scene in a production
* He eliminated box seats and created a classless theater in which every seat had good sight and sound, the fanlike arrangement is called **continental seating**.

Overall enhanced dramas with greater sensory appeal. Action became more important than works and the director replaced the writer.

A number of the innovations observed in Wagner's productions were assimilated into the art of film. He was the dominant director. In film, *auteur* is used to describe the central role of the director, the creative force.

His position was summarized as:

> It is primarily from this demand for artistic unity and its corollary - the all powerful director or regisseur (auteur) that Wagner's enormous influence on the modern theater stems.

## Wagner and the Music Drama

Theodor Adorno one of Germany's foremost philosophers and critics after World War II, described Wagner's work as Das Kino der Zukunft, cinema of the future.

Achieved musical unity without sacrificing the dramatic flow of the story.

When music is completely subordinate to dramatic form, it tends to be dull and insipid and when music dominates, drama often moves in a ponderous, interrupted manner.

The solution to this problem was to create periodic breaks in the plot in order to allow for musical reflection. Solo aria, song in musicals, soliloquies in Shakespearean tragedies.

The *Flying Dutchman* has two principal themes, the Dutchman and the Redemption themes.

## Trailer

Max Steiner suggested that if Wagner had lived in the 20th century, he would have been a film composer.

Wagner underscored the emotional qualities, establishing moods and created specific visual images.

The music of Wagner is best known by many for the Bugs Bunny animated short:

"What's Opera Doc?"

Selected Films with Music by Wagner:

The Birth of a Nation: The ride of the Valkyrie
Dracula: Der Meistersinger
Nosferatu: Das Rheingold
Apocalypse Now: The ride of the Valkyrie
Romeo and Juliet: Tristan and Isolde

# Drama and Film

## Elements of Drama

Five elements frequently associated with drama:

* Plot
* Character
* Setting
* Theme
* Mood

**Epic** stories tend to have a long string of complications that lead to a number of climaxes, while conveying a larger story of a person's life or a major event.

**Plot**:

Two basic plot structures:

**Causal Plot**:

Four principles:

1. Exposition: The necessary background information for the story to unfold.
2. Complications: A series of events stemming from a conflict, each complication leads to the next, generally building in intensity.
3. Climax: The moment of greatest tension, when the complications come to a head.
4. Resolution: The end of the story, complications are resolved, and the loose ends are tied together.

**Episodic Plot**:

An episodic plot presents a succession of events that do not build directly from one to the next. These episodes often function as brief subplots.

**Character**:

Among the techniques that contribute to characterization in film are the character's actions, physical appearance, language, camera technique, music.

**Setting**:

The location and the time frame in which a story takes place.

**Theme**:

A theme is the central idea underlying a given story. Theme provides the intellectual meaning. Films impart meaningful messages that can have a profound impact on an audience.

**Mood**:

The mood or tone of the film is the combination of emotions it conveys. The mood of a film can be sad, whimsical, profound, dark, etc.

MASH has a comic mood.

**Film Editing**:

**Crosscutting**: Alternation of shots from two or more sequences. Like someone in danger and someone coming to their rescue.

Same with Empire Strikes Back where you have Luke training with Yoda, then Han on Bespin and Darth Vader plotting against the heroes.

**Post production**: film is given its final shape through the editing process and the addition of sound effects and music.

**Montage**: Section of film comprising a number of brief shots edited together in order tot show a condensed series of events.

Montage is an effective device for showing travel, the passing of time, and frenetic chaos of battle.

# Chapter 3: Elements of Music

## Music Notation

Music has three properties:

pitch, duration, color

**Pitch**: how high or low a music note is.

**Measure**: A single vertical line appears at regular intervals on the musical staff.

**Time signature**: tells us how many beats there are in a measure.

## Elements of Pitch and Duration

Music has 5 basic elements:

* Melody
* Texture
* Harmony
* Rhythm
* Timbre

### Melody

**Range**: The distance between the highest and lowest notes of a melody
**Intervals**: the distance between one pitch and the next

When a melody contains a significant number of large intervals it is called **disjunct**, while one that moves primarily in small intervals is called **conjunct**.

A vocal melody needs to leave space for people to breathe, and these rests define melodic units called **phrases**.

The end of phrases are the **cadences** and are the musical equivalent of punctuation marks.

The endings that seem to be incomplete, similar to commas or question marks, are **open cadences**, while clear and complete, like periods and exclamation points are **closed cadences**.

**Motive**: A motive is a small melodic idea that can serve as part of a larger melody or stand on its own.

John Williams created a memorable and frightening motive in Jaws with only two notes.

**Theme**: a melody that recurs within a given work, usually with special significance to the drama.

### Texture

Melodies are often played with a musical accompaniment in the background. The relationship of the melodic line to other musical material in a given passage is called the **texture**.

**Homophonic**: Single dominant melody with accompaniment or music that seemingly has no dominant tune.

**Monophonic**: Presentation of a single melodic line without any other musical material. Like Gregorian chanting.

The presence of two or more equal melodies is called a **contrapuntal** texture or a **counterpoint**. The melodies are often similar to eachother, like in Frere Jacques.

### Harmony

The element of music that is created when two or more pitches are produced at the same time.

**chord**: denotes the sound of three or more pitches at once.

Dissonant chords without resolution denote a disturbing mood, suggesting that something is wrong.

**interval**: the distance between two pitches, intervals of thirds and sixths are generally stable, seconds and sevenths are unstable and create dissonance. Intrvals of 4ths and 5ths are considered to be strong, and Star Wars has a number of fourth and fifth intervals that contribute to the heroic quality of the theme.

**Diminished 5th/Agumented 4th/Tritone**: This interval creates great tension both melodically and harmonically in traditional Western music.

Octave is divided into 12 equal intervals called **half steps**.

The majority of music that you hear is set in **major keys**. **Minor keys** often provide a darker, more menacing sound.

Major = Luke Skywalker's Theme
Minor = Darth Vader's Theme

The keys can also be used to indicate transformation of a character. When Luke Skywalker is sad or in trouble, John Williams plays Luke's theme more slowly and in a minor key, giving it a sense of thoughtfulness and danger.

**Microtones**: sounds smaller than half a step.

### Rhythm

Structured into a series of recurring pulses called **beats**.

The speed at which pulses are heard is the **tempo**. Fast tempo generates excitement and conflict, while a slow tempo indicates calm and might accompany a love scene.

Often films have a tempo where the beat is exactly equivalent to 1 second, so 60bpm. This is because it makes it easy to calculate how much music is needed to match the length of a specific scene.

Beats occur in regular patterns of strong and weak pulses called **meters**.

The strongest beat is the first of the group.

Accents on weak beats or between beats is called **syncopation**.

### Timbre

The technical term for the color or tone quality produced by voices, instruments and various combinations.

**orchestration** is the process of assigning voices and instruments to a simple composition on a piano, for example.

### Voices

Voices can be used to convey feeling. Deep voice vs high voice, soft vs gruff, etc.
