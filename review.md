1. Wagner's **Gesamtkunstwerk**: Concept of the total artwork. The individual arts could not reach their highest level of perfection by themselves and he suggested that drama was the greatest unifying art form:

He brought together brilliant philosophy and literature in the libretto, stunning visual elements in the scenery, costumes and lighting, and the best of the performing arts in the acting and music.

His concept of Gesamtkunstwerk can be seen in his masterpieces:

*Tristan und Isolde* and the cycle of four operas *Der Ring des Nibelungen*.

Wagner as **Auteur**:

Wagner created a single vision for all of the arts by maintaining strict control over each of them; he wrote his own librettos that express his philosophies, he meticulously directed the staging and acting, he dictated the visual elements of the scenery, costumes and lighting, and he composed the music.

His greatest theatrical innovations:

* The auditorium was darkened during the performance
* He widened the distance between the audience and the stage with a double proscenium
* He created an orchestra pit that extended beneath the stage, so that the audience would not see the musicians
* Members of the orchestra were not allowed to tune their instruments in the pit
* The audience was asked not to applaud during the performance
* He insisted upon acting rehearsals before singing rehearsals
* Unique and detailed scenery and visual effects were created for each scene in a production
* He eliminated box seats and created a classless theater, in which every seat had equally good sight and sound. The fanlike arrangement is now called *continental* seating

Director became the central figure, replacing the writer.

In film, *auteur* is used to describe the central role of the director, the creative force.

His most significant contribution was his ability to achieve musical unity without sacrificing the dramatic flow of the story.

They used to separate music and drama, create periodic breaks in the plot in order to allow for musical reflection, which can then take on recognized musical forms.

Wagner's innovation was the creation of continuous musical flow. Allowed the drama to move in a natural manner, without interruptions or reflection.

He created musical themes that represent various characters and aspects of the story, called **leitmotifs**.

2. Music as the Opening and Closing Frames

Music is often heard throughout the opening and closing credits, providing a musical frame for the film as a whole.

In accompanying the main title and opening credits, music can fill a variety of functions:

* Alerting the audience, often with brass fanfares, to the beginning of the film
* Introducing the dominant musical theme of the film as a whole
* Presenting several musical themes that will be heard in the film; when the music contains a series of tunes from the film like in musicals, it is called a **Medley**.
* Establishing the mood of the film as a whole or of the opening scene.
* Foreshadowing significant aspects of the story

Music for the closing credits may similarly reflect the mood at the end of a film or simply create a cheerful ambiance for the exiting audience.

They can also sometimes include a new song, which could lead to a possible Oscar nomination for Best Song and boost sales.

3. Function of Film Music

### Establishing a Mood

All music appeals to some mood. There is often an overriding mood, usually suggested in the music for the opening credits such as in Star Wars.

**running counter to the action** is when the music depicts a mood that deliberately does not match what is happening on the screen.

Climax of Godfather, hear sacred organ music as Michael kills his enemies.

### Supporting the Plot

Music reflects the emotions of a given scene or moment. When character becomes angry, hear a rise in intensity, or triumphant music when victory is at hand.

Plot is moved forward by the music, you can know when some plot point is complete, like a car chase, when the exciting music stops.

Can also reflect physical movement, like a slap in the face or an object hitting the ground can be accompanied by an accent in the orchestra. If this is done too much, it is called **Mickey Mousing**.

## Establishing Character, Setting, Point of View, Theme

leitmotifs, the appearance of a dashing romantic character can be accompanied by a passionate melody. A soldier can be supported by a strong march, and a worldly woman might appear accompanied by a raspy sax.

The time and place of a movie can also be supported by music, indicating the period in history or music related to the geographic location.

4. Musical Unity

Film scores can be unified by a consistent mood, timbre and style.

In E.T. for example, a single memorable theme dominates the score, creating a different kind of unity.

### Leitmotif

Theme connected with a person, object, or idea in a story.

One of the best known leitmotifs in film is the two-note oscillating motive that accompanies Jaws.

### Thematic Transformation

helps to create variety and gives support to dramatic situations. A leitmotif can be altered when it recurs during a film. The alteration can be a change of instrumentation, tempo or harmony. Through these transformations, the changing mood or state of a character can be depicted.

The Death of Darth Vader, for example, is accompanied by his theme, which is usually powerful and menacing, but is now gentle and sorrowful.

5. Musical Accompaniment / Placement of Music / Types of Music

The size of the venue was a significant factor in determining the size of the accompanying musical ensemble.

In the first decade of twentieth century, principal venue shifted from theaters to nickelodeons, small shops that showed films exclusively, therefore limited to certain sounds:

* Films were shown in silence
* Films could be shown without music, but with added sound effects, narration, or a lecture by a professor
* Music might be played continuously in the background, often by a mechanical device such as a phonograph or a player piano
* Music played by a phonograph or player piano was known as ballyhoo music
* A single pianist filled a variety of musical needs for a film presentation
* A small number of musicians could perform with the pianist, a drummer, with sound effects, and a singer who entertained between films.

In some places, music was just before, during reel changes, and after the film.

While others would use music as sound effects, like playing a piano if someone in the movie was playing a piano.

In others, music was performed continuously during a film.

A chase scene might have fast music, battle loud music, etc.

Types of music varied from well-known classics and popular melodies to improvisations in traditional or popular style.

Popular music seems to have been preferred.

Edison chose popular music for the Kinetophone, and likewise vaudeville theaters and nickelodeons tended to wards popular music styles.

Live music **adds to the illusion of reality** in these narrative films, as well as **hiding the noise of the projector**, which would have been a loud and constant reminder that the images are emanating from a machine.

The **energy and emotion of musicians helped compensate for lack of live actors**, the energy and emotion of the musicians helped bridge the gap from live theater to recorded film.

6. Developments in Film Music: Musical Accompaniment

By 1920, music performed by a single pianist was giving way to a greater variety of accompaniments. Wurlitzer, America's largest organ maker, began producing special instruments designed for movie theaters.

Additional mechanical devices were created for the instrument so that musicians could produce non-musical sound effects like a rooster, car horn, telephone, gunshot.

*One-Man Motion Picture Orchestra*, *Pipe-Organ Orchestra*.

Throughout 1910s, new theaters were larger and more ornate. Musical ensembles often increased in size as well.

A group of 5-10 musicians, including a pianist, could achieve an effective accompaniment, similar in sound to what one hears on radio shows.

By the 1920s, a number of theaters featured symphony orchestras of over 50 people. **The association of symphony orchestras with quality productions was clearly established by 1920.**

7. Camille Saint-Saens

One of the first completely original film scores for orchestra created for the Film d'Art in Paris.

Engaged the leading stage actors in France to perform quality dramas based on history or mythology.

First production, *L'Assassinat du Duc de Guise (1908)*, turned out one of France's most prestigious composers, Camille Saint-Saens.

Best know for his symphonies, concertos, operas and popular work like The Carnival of Animals and Danse Macabre, Saint-Saens also composed incidental music for stage plays.

He had composed music for three plays in 1902, including Racine's Andromaque.

The concert version of *L'Assassinat du Duc de Guise* reveals four important aspects about the first film score:

First, the published version is written for twelve instrument, a combination which was unusual for concert music, but is typical for good theater orchestras.

Musical style is based on nineteeth century traits, including an emphasis on melody and a strong emotional content.

Frequent mood changes within each movement mirror the dramatic action. Film recounts the murder of the French duke by King Henry III in 1588, and the music aptly supports this tragic tale.

Most convincing are the fourth and fifth scenes depicting the brutal attack and horrified reaction of the Duke's lover.

Recurring themes among the five movements suggest that Saint-Saens employed a system of leitmotifs, themes associated with characters in the film. Basic elements of the classical film score are already present in Saint Saen's initial conception.
