# Erich Wolfgang Korngold (1897-1957)

Born in 1897 in Vienna.

* Childhood prodigy
* Teachers include Strauss and Mahler
* 1934, Mendelssohn's *A Midsummer Night's Dream*
* Liked Hollywood, returned several times over the next few years to do scores.

He wins an award for **Anthony Adverse (1936)**.

* In 1938 Krongold was asked to do **Robin Hood** but initially refused
* Austria annexed by the Nazis and all of his family's wealth and property was seized
* Academy Award for **Robin Hood** - first time award was given directly to composer, not head of music department
* Remained in Hollywood, died in 1957, disappointed that he was never able to regain his position as a serious composer
* Freelanced, composed only 19 film scores in 12 years.

Wrote in a 19th century romantic style (Like Wagner and Strauss) - considered his scores to be like *little operas*.

* Focus on extended melodies
* Phrased the drama (neatly moving back and forth between the two extremes, creating a mood and then hits the action at specific moment)
* Developed a series of approaches for battle scenes:
  * Loud dynamics
  * Use of rapid scale passages (like in the Simpsons)
  * Irregular, aggressive accents (Isengard theme)
  * Occasional motive reference (Star Wars, exciting interchanged with the Force theme)
* Also made use of the Overture at the beginning of each film presenting the main themes

Broadway style musicals have Overture, where they showcase 15-20 seconds of what the big hit songs are.

ABA = get a theme, a contrasting theme, and then the first theme again.

In Korngold's films, it was the main theme for the hero, then the contrasting theme for the love interest, then the main theme for the hero again.

## The Sea Hawk (1940)

* Extended themes
* Use of music in battle scene

Scene 1:

* Opening credits - uses an overture - heroic/love/heroic
* Heroic theme uses brass fanfare / love theme uses strings

Scene 2:

* Phrases the drama - sets the mood and parallels the battle
* Drops under dialog - hits the thrown knife - drops pacing under the retreat
* Blending of source and score with the sounding of the retreat

## The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)

Scene 1: Opening - Overture: 3 Themes - Musical form? Represents?

* First two based on a march - a group activity - theme for the Merry Men
* Final theme sounds like the love theme, Strings 6th interval, same as love them for Empire Strikes Back

Scene 2: Saxons in Peril / Robin Hood

* Saxons in Peril theme like a cry or a plea - often heard when we see the persecution of the Saxons
* Robin Hood theme, short fanfare (but not in the opening credits)

Scene 3: Little John

* Theme will be used when main characters join the merry men
* First heard with Little John - French Horn (operatic link to hunter or woodsman)
* Stylistic blend of source music
* Hitting the action during the duel (played for comedy)
* Woodwind water theme - similar to many operatic examples
* Concludes with merry men theme

Scene 4: Friar Tuck

* Similar to Little John scene
* Initial theme played primarily on bassoon and muted trumpet - comic
* Sword fight - same theme as Little John battle - more exciting / swords
* Woodwind *water* theme again
* Concludes with merry men theme

Scene 5: Marion and Robin 1

* Quiet variation of the Peril theme as Marion sees the Saxons
* Two themes during Marion/Robin dialog - second theme from opening credits
* Which is the love theme or are both?

Scene 6: Marion and Robin 2

* Love theme 1 for the big smooch - big strings / moment of spectacle
* Love theme 2 - quiet cello - much more intimate

Themes that make it into the main title: the Merry men theme and the love of country theme for Richard.

This was at the end of the Great Depression in 1938, the notion that if we all work together we can get through this was heavy.
