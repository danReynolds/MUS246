1. Transition from Silent Film to Sound Film

Dialogue very awkward, no script writers yet.
Acting styles had to change from demonstrative approach.

Talking films were expensive, we get the Studio System with big companies to cover costs:

Studio system includes everything they need to make a film is at the studio and everyone works for the studio. Actors, directors, film editing, script writers, composers, musicians all full-time employed by the studio, you can therefore best estimate cost.

* Bring together all the elements needed to make films under one company.
* By the early 1930s, Hollywood is divided into 8 studios:
1. The Big Five: MGM, Paramount, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, RKO
2. The Little Three: Universal, Colombia, United Artists

Big five had their own film distribution networks and theater chains.

2. Changes in Aesthetics and Technology with the Sound Film

* Aesthetics:
  * Change in technology = change in aesthetics
  * Many silent actors were out of business, they had awful voices or thick accents
  * Had to have musicians and sound effects on set since they couldn't be added later

* Technology:
  * Cameras in large booths, needed to shoot through a pane of glass otherwise the microphone would pick up the sound of the camera

3. Max Steiner (1888-1971)

First major studio composer.

* Born in Vienna, middle class, father owned a theater.
* Formally trained in the tradition of European classical music.
* Child prodigy, conducting in theater by age 12, touring as a conductor by 16.
* One of his teachers was Gustav Mahler.
* Wrote operettas, first by age 17.
* Also worked as a composer and conductor of music for stage in England.
* Facing deportation because of WW1 comes to US in 1914.

He worked on Broadway for 15 years. Invited to Hollywood in 1929 with **Rio Rita**.

**The Blue Angel (1930)** all music originates from a diegetic source.

Max Steiner liked how quickly he could get music recorded, Hollywood streams getting his music out there real fast.

But Broadway Musicals become less popular, switch to scripts, and someone asks if non-diegetic music would be confusing.

For a while, there is no music in Hollywood films because they are scripted films, not broadway musicals, so why have music in a serious talkie?

## King Kong (1933)

* Worried that it would be a flop
* Steiner was asked to do a compiled score
* Convinces producer to create original score

The initial screenings without music had people laughing, not afraid. But Steiner wrote his own score, and people loved it.

It's only 1933, and Steiner writes a theme that is atonal, centered on three descending notes.

Other films: Gone With the Wind (1939), Casablanca (1942), A Summer Place (1959)

4. Korngold (1897-1957)

Born in 1897 in Vienna. Childhood prodigy, son of noted music critic. Teachers included Strauss and Mahler.

1934, Mendelssohn's *A Midsummer Night's Dream*.

Liked Hollywood, returned several times over the next few years to do scores.

## Anthony Adverse (1936)

He wins an award for **Anthony Adverse (1936)**.

* In 1938 Korngold was asked to do **Robin Hood** but initially refused
* Austria annexed by the Nazis and all of his family's wealth and property was seized
* Academy Award for **Robin Hood** - first time award was given directly to composer, not head of music department
* Remained in Hollywood, died in 1957, disappointed that he was never able to regain his position as a serious composer
* Freelanced, composed only 19 film scores in 12 years.

Wrote in a 19th century romantic style (Like Wagner and Strauss) - considered his scores to be like *little operas*.

* Focus on extended melodies
* Phrased the drama (neatly moving back and forth between the two extremes, creating a mood and then hits the action at specific moment)
* Developed a series of approaches for battle scenes:
  * Loud dynamics
  * Use of rapid scale passages (like in the Simpsons)
  * Irregular, aggressive accents (Isengard theme)
  * Occasional motive reference (Star Wars, exciting interchanged with the Force theme)
* Also made use of the Overture at the beginning of each film presenting the main themes

## The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)

Scene 1: Opening - Overture: 3 Themes - Musical form? Represents?

* First two based on a march - a group activity - theme for the Merry Men
* Final theme sounds like the love theme, Strings 6th interval, same as love theme for Empire Strikes Back

Scene 2: Saxons in Peril / Robin Hood

* Saxons in Peril theme like a cry or a plea - often heard when we see the persecution of the Saxons
* Robin Hood theme, short fanfare (but not in the opening credits)

Scene 3: Little John

Scene 5: Marion and Robin 1

* Quiet variation of the Peril theme as Marion sees the Saxons
* Two themes during Marion/Robin dialog - second theme from opening credits
* Which is the love theme or are both?

Scene 6: Marion and Robin 2

* Love theme 1 for the big smooch - big strings / moment of spectacle
* Love theme 2 - quiet cello - much more intimate

Themes that make it into the main title: the Merry men theme and the love of country theme for Richard.

This was at the end of the Great Depression in 1938, the notion that if we all work together we can get through this was heavy.

# Style of Korngold

* Romantic, orchestral style operatic approach
* Use of themes, often long and evolved
* Often phrases the dramatic

* Musical theme linked to Laura - Orchestral but Jazz influenced. Theme (with lyrics) was a major popular music hit
* End of the credits does not *resolve*, but continues on
* **Pedal Point** under monologue - sustained bass note under moving chords
* Monologue is *metadiegetic*, exists on the boundary between film world and audience

Scene 2/3: Lydecker's Story

* Source music is Laura's theme
* Transitions to score with the story

# Readings

1. Early Sound Cartoons

Steamboat Willie (1928) by Disney featured Mickey Mouse, parody of the Buster Keaton film Steamboat Bill.

Two most prominent melodies:

1. Steamboat Bill: An Irish folk song appearing at the beginning
2. Turkey in the Straw: A virtuoso performance by Mickey extracting musical sound from various animals

*Skeleton Dance* by Disney combines elements of the compilation score with music mirroring specific gestures of the skeleton crew. Other Silly Symphonies relate short stories.

Disney recruited Carl Stalling to add sound to his animations, a silent film organist and orchestra director. In making the Skeleton Dance, Stalling helped develop an early version of the click track, a system in which holes places in a film create a clicking sound that can be made audible to the conductor and musicians of a studio orchestra.

He left Disney in 1930 and in 1936 went to Warner Bros, where he remained for 22 years composing for Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies.

2. The Classical Film Score

Among the features of the classical film score are the following:

* Extensive use of music
* Exploitation of the full range of orchestral colors
* Reliance upon the melody-dominated postromantic style
* Establishment of the principal themes and moods during the opening title and credits
* Musical support for dramatic moods, settings, characters and action
* Frequent borrowing of familiar melodies
* Unity through leitmotifs and thematic transformation

These characteristics are found in the three films from 1935: Mutiny on the Bounty, The Informer, The Bridge of Frankenstein

3. The Adventures of Robin Hood

Warner Bros brought in Korngold from Vienna to Hollywood and in a trilogy of films:

Captain Blood, Anthony Adverse, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Korngold establishes a model for underscoring action films.

Critics have hailed the work as the first masterpiece of film music. Essential to its conception are the swashbuckling fight scenes, for which Korngold employed a style incorporating the following characteristics:

* A full symphonic orchestration, emphasizing brass and percussion
* Loud dynamics
* Passages of quick notes
* Irregular and hard accents
* Occasional motive references

These elements combine to create a hectic character, suggesting the chaos of battle. With the addition of sound effects, this simple formula became a cliche for future action films, including Star Wars.

Followed the principles of Wagner, the Auteur, with complex Leitmotifs greater than those of Steiner in the Informant.

For example, the love theme also shares a similar contour with the first four notes of the King Richard theme, suggesting a close association: love of country, love of Marian.

4. The Hays Code

In the 1920s, movies were still pretty new, scandals in films fueled moral debates.

Fearing government censorship, in 1922, Hollywood created the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America Inc, for the purpose of improving moral image.

Will Hays was a lawyer who had a served as Chairman of the Republican National Committee, in the 1920s he helped create a list of *Dont's and Be Careful's*. In 1930 the Hays Code was published:

1. No picture shall be produced which will lower the moral standards of those who see it. The sympathy of the audience shall never be thrown to the side of crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin.

2. Correct standards of life, subject only to the requirements of drama and entertainment shall be presented.

3. Law, natural or human, shall not be ridiculed, nor shall sympathy be created for its violation.

Code also sought to eliminate profanity, the gratuitous use of liquor, sex outside of proper family relations, and nudity.

By 1934, the Catholic Church was influencing the Hays office.

For *Gone with the Wind*, Selznik opted to pay a fine of $5000 to say *I don't give a damn*, while damn was a forbidden word.

The Hays Office closed in 1945, but the Code remained in effect until 1968 when a rating system took its place.

5. Modern Music in Hollywood

In the US, two styles of concert music exerted an influence on Hollywood:

* Expressionism

In the early 30s and 40s, Hollywood invited prestigious composers to write for films. MGM contacted both Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg, two of the leading composers of the century. Both lived in Hollywood for a time, but neither completed a studio score.

Expressionism is characterized by continuous dissonant harmony and disjunct melodies.

Hanns Eisler, a German student of Schoenberg was the first to bring expressionism into Hollywood film studios and is credited for writing the first films core using serialism.

The dark, dissonant sound created by serial techniques represents the German repression of Czechoslovakia. A socialist, Eisler was among the first Hollywood figures called before the House Un-American Activities Committee under suspicion of promoting Communism

Eisler voluntarily deported to East Germany.

* American Nationalism

Aaron Copland, American's leading nationalist composer. Best known for his ballets Appalachian Spring, Rodeo and Billy the Kid.

Copland established a distinctive American style. Melodies featuring strong intervals, syncopated rhythms, colorful orchestration and a modern but relatively conservative harmonic system.

His music influenced a number of film composers including Leonard Bernstein and John Williams.

Of Mice and Men received Oscar nominations for both Best Picture and best Original Score in Hollywood's greatest year 1939.

6. Film Noir

Term first used by French film critics in 1946. Dark and pessimistic. Images are black and white with strong contrasts of light and dark creating deep shadows.

Style applied to films including: Spellbound, The Lost Weekend

The typical film noir plot is modeled after detective stories from the 1930s.

The American detective, as opposed to the British Sherlock Holmes style detective, was tough, pragmatic, not necessarily above flouting the law and smart enough to resolve complicated cases with dogged determination and a strong jaw.

Most of these films feature voice-over narration by one of the main characters.

Women in film noir tend to be alluring, sexually active and dangerous.

The prototype of the genre is the Maltese Falcon, but the movement burst on the scene in 1944 with:

Double Indemnity, Murder, My Sweet, Laura.

Happy endings where the boy gets the girl were replaced with tragic and ambiguous conclusions and disturbing musical sounds.

The following are typical elements of a film noir score:

* One prevailing mood, generally dark and pessimistic
* Minimal musical cues
* Orchestration for small ensembles
* Prominent low-pitched instruments, such as the bass clarinet
* Emphasis on the lower registers of the strings
* Use of non-traditional orchestral sound, often a wavering pitch
* Angular, disjunct melodies
* Harsh dissonant harmonies
* The use of jazz, the musical sound of cities at night, as source music and sometimes underscoring

## Laura

David Raksin's Laura is treated unusually for Film Noir. Instead of portraying her sexual activity within a negative social stereotype, she is given the character of a modern, sophisticated woman.

Essential to building her positive image is the music, which relies heavily on the idiom of popular music.

Rejected *Sophisticated Lady* as the principal theme for Laura, created his own.

## Film Noir Scores by Miklos Rozsa

Earned much of his reputation for film noir scores, including Double Indemnity and The Killers.

Incorporated the style into three major films:

The Lost Weekend, Spellbound, Double Life.

The Lost Weekend focused on the realistic effects of alcoholism, while Hollywood tended to glamorize drinking at the time.

In his second Oscar nomination, *A Double Life* Rosza combines Shakespeare and Film Noir, and Othello is featured as a play within the film.

7. Miklos Rosza

Born in Hungary, studied film composition in Germany. Came to Hollywood with Alexander Korda. Created the music for the Jungle Book, became the first film score
