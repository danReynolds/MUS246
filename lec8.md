# Into the 1970s

Since the end of the 1940s, film music has been moving away from the conventions of Seiner and Korngold.

* Increasing influence of American composers
* Increasing importance of popular music and jazz
* Increasing importance of non-western musics and sounds, not in cultural accuracy, but in the creation of new sounds.
* Increasing importance of atonality - music as sonic texture

* Conglomeration continues, started in 60s but takes off in 70s. Movies are becoming big business. Companies are coming in and buying record studios, publishing companies, etc.
* Film cost increases: 72-77, 178%: 77-79: 200%
* 1970s: 160 films per year, much lower than in the 30s and 40s. They are being safe, sequels are considered safe and become popular
* 1937: 538 films are produced
* Genre/formula films
* Old school seen as irrelevant
* Pop scores: **The Graduate (1967)**, **Easy Rider (1969)**, **The Last Picture Shown (1971)**, **American Graffiti (1973)**
* Cheaper
* Promotion

Films where the entire score is made up of popular songs, can all become hits and promote the record.

## John Williams

* Born in 1932 to musical parents
* Trained as a concert pianist at Juilliard
* Studied film music at UCLA
* Started as an orchestrator for Tiompkin
* Worked in television from late 1950s on, Lost in Space, a CBS rip off of Star Trek, and Gilligan's Island, not the main theme but other stuff.
* Late 1960s, did film work

## Sugarland Express (1974)

* His breakout film, starring Goldie Hawn
* First major film by boy wonder director Steven Spielberg. Making his own films at home by age 8.
* Directing television shows by age 19
* Got a big break when asked to direct an episode of the Twilight Zone, the episode starred an elderly star Betty Davis. She was at the end of her career and had a 21 year old directing her. She came in and realized that they had given her a child as a director and wanted to walk off the production. By the time they were done, she realized she was working with the absolute best director ever.

## Jaws (1975)

* New approach to film promotion and release
* 400 screens: Wide Release

Prior to Jaws, a movie would open at one place at a time essentially, traveling around from popular places to smaller, maybe on 1 or 2 theaters.

You built up excitement for a film at a major theater and then when it finally gets to you, you're super excited. Jaws, however, was the first film put into wide release, opening on 400 screens nationwide.

When Rogue One came out, it was on 400 screens in like Hamilton.

Jaws made its money back in 13 days, rather than the 72 days normally taken to consider a film not a failure.

Jaws launched the modern era of film distribution.

Jaws began a shift in the attitude towards orchestral music in film. Helped reestablish the orchestra as an important force in film music.

Used the big orchestra in ways like in the era of Korngold and Steiner.

Animatronic shark was not working, frequently had to stop shooting because of it.

Steven Spielberg gets a call from John Williams, who has a theme for the shark. It is the two tones, repeated, there is no sense of intelligence to it, it is just an incessant repeating animalistic danger.

Williams uses a Fugue in Jaws. It repeats on itself.

## Star Wars (1977)

* Becomes the best known film composer of all time with the success of Star Wars

Lucas and Spielberg each gave eachother 2.5% of eachother's films, because they thought their own would do poorly.

Williams uses an overture to start Star Wars with an ABA theme. It drops us straight into the action.

In the initial battle, we hear the first theme, the Empire's theme. It is played aggressively with the brass.

Love theme is a sixth, out of the Korngold playbook for Leia.

Best musical moment in the movie comes fairly early on, with the Twin Binary Suns. He looks out over the dunes. It's beautiful. This is the first time Lucas uses the Force Theme. This is the end of his normal life, he goes on to chase R2D2 and start his new life. Rich use of tonality, hummable melodies, not atonal.

While John Williams is influenced by Erich Korngold, he is a modern film composer. While he can use aspects of them, he is doing his own thing and working in strongly modernist styles.

Scene where Joey is being chased by shark in the water. Never see the shark but the music and the combination of the broken pier tells you exactly what is happening.

## Stravinsky

One of the early composers interested in writing music that expanded the idea of tonality, even before 12-tone was developed. He has a huge influence on early John Williams scores.

Sand people theme is taken after the Rights of Springs from Stravinsky.

## Style of Williams

* 19th century orchestral tradition
* But aware of the newer modernist/atonal techniques
* Little popular jazz influence - no popular songs
* Starts with a basic orchestra and then adds what is necessary
* Use of themes - developed through the film

Unlike Hermann, who can write with any combo of instruments, Williams always starts with an orchestra as his default setting and adds instruments to that as needed for the particular project.

Brings back big, memorable themes.

1980-1993 he is the conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra:

* His film work is reworked into orchestral works. The Boston Pops would do concerts and then in the middle, put in the concert arrangement for the Empire Strikes Back, etc.
* Self-contained concert pieces
* Music takes on a life outside the film world
* He has the second most academy nominations in the world, second to Walt Disney

## James Horner (1953 - 2015)

* American Born
* Grew up in England where he attended the Royal College of Music
* Felt that film composing was not a serious artistic outlet
* Began composing for film while at UCLA in 1978 for the American Film Institute (AFI)

The Lady in Red (1979)

Breakthrough score was for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)

Among his best-known work: Aliens (1986), Field of Dreams (1989), Braveheart (1996), Apollo 13 (1996)

## Titanic

Greatest success came in 1997: Titanic for which he won two academy awards, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, *My Heart Will Go On*.

Characteristics:

* Strong melodic composer, often works with the conventional orchestra
* Also capable of incorporating electronic and avant-garde sounds in his work
* Very strong at synchronizing music to visual elements such as scene and camera changes (not Mickey Mousing)
* Despite not having a strong background in Popular music, is also adept at writing in popular styles - My Heart Will Go On, with Celine Dion

The technique that is his dead giveaway is his extraordinary ability to synchronize his music to visuals.

## Glory (1989)

Boys choir is used.

## Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)

* Electronic scores
* Electronic instruments are nothing new:
  * Rosza and the Theremin

## Forbidden Planet (1956)

* All electronic score
* Louis and Bebe Barron
* Increasing interest in the avant-garde
* No clear conventions for the audience to read

By the end of the 1960s, smaller, modular synthesizers were replacing the earlier, larger models

## Switched on Bach (1968)

Album that put the synthesizer into public knowledge.

## Walter / Wendy Carlos (1939-presents)

* A Clockwork Orange (1971)
* The Shining (1980)
* Tron (1982)

## Vangelis (1943-present)

* Chariots of Fire (1981)
* Blade Runner (1982)

## Witness (1985)

* Passacaglia: Variations over a repeating baseline
* Synths preteneding to be an orchestra - the modern hiding with the old

## Pop Musicians

Advent of MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) in 1983, and increasingly powerful synthesizers and computers have allowed musicians without formal training to compose and produce film scores.

It is a set of specifications for designing music using computers and allow synthesizers to talk to other synthesizers.

* By early 1980s synthesizers have become more powerful and less expensive.
* Increased use in popular music.
* More frequent use in film scores (cost/control) opens opportunities for pop composers who lack classical training.

You do not need to be a specialist in writing down notes, that door has opened because of synthesizers.

## Danny Elfman

Breathrough score was for Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

Directed by Tim Burton.

Criticized for not being able to read music. Apparently he can.

Influences include Bernard Herrman and **The Day the Earth Stood Still**.

### Characteristics

* Frantic/Carnivalesque
* Frequent use of 3/4 (waltz rhythm) time and 2/4 time (polka rhythm).
* Frequent use of celeste and wordless choir to evoke sense of childlike wonder
* Hitting the action - to the point of Mickey Mousing.

## Beetlejuice (1988_)

Elfman likes lone woodwinds.


## Edward Scissorhands (1992)


* He uses Polka as cutting dog's hair.
* He uses a Tango for all women except the mother, some mickey mousing
* For mother, there is innocent, open theme


## Hans Zimmer (1957-present)

Born in Germany, had a piano in his house and taught himself how to play it.

He was interested in the piano as a noise machine, in addition to purely a musical instrument. He was constantly trying to make it produce more sounds, taking off panels, playing inside it, etc

Late 1970s/early 1980s he would be a freelance pop music keyboardist. Best known as for working with the Buggles, Video Killed the Radio Star. First music video ever played on MTV.


1980, working on jingles brought him to the attention of British film composer, Stanley Myles.

## Rainman (1988)

Breathrough film for Zimmer.

Early films such as Rain Man and Driving Miss Daisy (1989) made extensive use of synthesizers


Most recent works are best described as spacious and powerful: a fusing of electronics and orchestra. Often has an emphasis on timbre and rhythm rather than melody.

Work with Christopher Nolan on Batman Trilogy.

Minimalism: simple idea - repetition - complexity of layers - slow changes over time

## Interstellar

* Scene between Matthew and his mother who is now old.
* Music and film are edited simultaneously
* Cues sometimes assembled from multiple pieces of music

Hans Zimmer typically starts writing the music before the film is finished, which is atypical. 

## Inception (2010)

The Zimmer Effect, make it sound like him as closely as possible without copyright infringement
