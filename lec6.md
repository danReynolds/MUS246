# Style of Korngold

* Romantic, orchestral style operatic approach
* Use of themes, often long and evolved
* Often phrases the dramatic
* Allowing themes to unfold without distortions
* Links hitting the action to comedy or key moments of drama

# Alfred Newman (1900-1970)

Depression era films were often spectacular or escapist

Lost Horizon (1937), The Wizard of Oz (1939)

Into the 1940s..

* The 1940s: interest in stories that are more realistic
* Psychological drama, complex motivations, character driven narrative
* The *dark side* of the human condition
* Film Noir
* In part driven by the cynicism brought on by World War II
* The 1940s are when we see an increase in the number of American born composers rising to prominence in Hollywood such as:

## Miklos Rosza (1907-1995)

* Hungarian
* Mother is a classical pianist
* Studied in Leipzig and Paris
* Successful career as a composer
* At the suggestion of Arthur Honegger, Rosza goes into film scoring (1934)
* Does some film work in England, 1934-1939
* Due to World War II, travels to US in 1939 to complete **The Thief of Baghdad (1940)**

## Jungle Book (1942)

* First soundtrack released on record

## Double Indemnity (1944)

* Short themes, unpredictable, unsettling
* Moving away from clear tonality, good Film Noir

## Modernist Style

* A response to the horrors of World War I
* 1945: Spellbound and The Lost Weekend
* Both nominated for Academy Awards (SB won)
* Both films are psychological in nature, dealing with disturbed characters
* Both used the Theremin

One of the first times we see the use of an electronic instrument in a film score.

## The Lost Weekend

### Part 1

* Begins with a sense of of positive urgency
* Becomes tonal/romantic with mention of Helen
* Comic/uncertain as he fumbles with hat and cigarette
* Turns darker as he sees the bottle, theremin enters
* Drama builds during the search - music playin the internal struggle

### Part 2

* Only source music - Burnham from the exterior - music would add drama - without it he appears pathetic

## David Raksin (1912-2004)

* Born in Philadelphia
* Father was a conductor for silent films
* Early career as pianist and arranger for Jazz bands in NY (Benny Goodman)
* Worked with Chaplin on Modern times - entry into film music (1935)

## Laura (1944)

* Director Otto Preminger wanted *Sophisticated lady* by Duke Ellington, about a prostitute
* Raskin composes own theme (famous heartbreak story)
* Psychological thriller (who-done-it)
* Motivations and misdirection
* Monothematic - based on a single theme
* Non-European sound - based on American Jazz
* Music not driving the suspense, more like the ghost or the ideal of Laura

Scene 1: Opening credits - Monologue

* Focus on the portrait of Laura - sophisticated/urban - almost unearthly
* Musical theme linked to Laura - Orchestral but Jazz influenced. Theme (with lyrics) was a major popular music hit
* End of the credits does not *resolve*, but continues on
* **Pedal Point** under monologue - sustained bass note under moving chords
* Monologue is *metadiegetic*, exists on the boundary between film world and audience
* Music ends with the first diegetic dialogue - transition into narrative

Scene 2/3: Lydecker's Story

* Source music is Laura's theme
* Transitions to score with the story
* Dialog between Lydecker and Laura is scored with a waltz - why?
* Laura's theme enters as she speaks her mind - this is the *real* Laura.
* Note how the music transitions back and forth from source to score.

Scene 4:

* Music follows McPherson's internal state as he searches the apartment.
* Note how the music is connected to the portrait.

* What happens when Laura returns to the apartment?

## 1950s

* End of the Studio System
* Challenge of new media - Television

Battle with television fought on two fronts:

* Technology
* Subject matter

**Technology**:

* Battle with television accelerates the move to all color movies
* Hollywood begins to experiment with various systems to create a widescreen image
* Multiple systems in competition (just like sound) such as Cinerama, CinemaScope, VistaVision
* Also saw the development of the first multi-channel sound systems for theatres
* Epic films: **Quo Vadis**, **The Robe**, **Julius Caesar**, **Lawrence of Arabia**, **Cleopatra**, **The Ten Commandments**

## Ben Hur

Music by Miklos Rosza.
